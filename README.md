### Personal Statement

All my life, computers have always amazed me. From building block code games to Java GUIs, seeing things I made appear on my screen made my eyes widen. Programming makes me feel like a magician, it allows me to manipulate my environment (albeit a virtual one) in a way that only sorcerers could. More than that, it gives me a way to express my creativity. Computer projects offer a brand new medium of expression that unlike any previous mediums. 

### Brief Portfolio Description

The majority of my projects were created as a way for me to entertain myself. I’ve always enjoyed making things, whether by drawing, photo-editing, or videography, and I view code as an extension of my desire to create. Ideas bounce around my head like ping-pong balls and often time programming is the most effective medium to communicate my thoughts. 

 I like to think of my head as a melting pot of satire, utilitarianism, and discovery, and my portfolio as a metal stew spilling out of the pot. While several of my projects were created satirically to capture my thoughts on the world around me, others are rooted in practicality or just the desire to explore different ideas. I like to explore several mediums for communicating my thoughts, including photo-editing and videography, but I often find that programming is the most effective way to play around with different ideas, and I think of my code projects as an extension of my art.


### How do you make?

First I am hit with inspiration, which gives me an overarching goal to aspire towards. This either comes in the form of combining two concepts that I’m thinking about, or from a practical perspective, like an assignment. From there, I start to plan out how I’m going to make it. I organize my directory, set up a github repository, and a heroku remote if necessary. I research any libraries I could use to accomplish smaller goals within the project. Then, I start to jump into the code and do as much as I can until I need to review the documentation, stackoverflow, medium, etc, repeat until the project is complete. Of course, sometimes the steps get jumbled up. For example, if I found an interesting library, that could inspire me to make a project with the library. 


### Why do you make?

Working on things makes me happy. Whether it’s a personal project or an assignment or anything else, I always get a strong sense of satisfaction from finishing a project. Moreover, personal projects are a fun way for me to express my thoughts about the world around me. I’ve never been the best with words and I like to be able to use other mediums to communicate those ideas.
