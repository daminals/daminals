# Personal Statement

All my life, computers have always amazed me. From building block code games to Java GUIs, seeing things I made appear on my screen made my eyes widen. Programming makes me feel like a magician, it allows me to manipulate my environment (albeit a virtual one) in a way that only sorcerers could. More than that, it gives me a way to express my creativity. Computer projects offer a brand new medium of expression that is unlike any previous mediums. 

# Brief Portfolio Description

The majority of my projects were created as a way for me to entertain myself. I’ve always enjoyed making things, whether by drawing, photo-editing, or videography, and I view code as an extension of my desire to create. Ideas bounce around my head like ping-pong balls and often time programming is the most effective medium to communicate my thoughts. 

While several of my projects were created satirically to capture my thoughts on the world around me, others are rooted in practicality or just the desire to explore different ideas. I like to explore several mediums for communicating my thoughts, including photo-editing and videography, but I often find that programming is the most effective way to play around with different ideas, and I think of my code projects as an extension of my art.

# Why do you make?

Working on things makes me happy. Whether it’s a personal project or an assignment or anything else, I always get a strong sense of satisfaction from finishing a project. Moreover, personal projects are a fun way for me to express my thoughts about the world around me. I’ve never been the best with words and I like to be able to use other mediums to communicate those ideas.
